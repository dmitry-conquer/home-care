                  care”, are administered by trained healthcare professionals who bring a wealth of medical expertise to your doorstep. The key word in this term is “health,” as
                  this type of care requires clinical proficiency. This category includes registered nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language
                  pathologists, and other skilled caregivers. As such, home healthcare agencies focus on providing specialized medical assistance. While A+ Home Care does not
                  provide home health care services in Pittsburgh, PA, we want to help inform your decision on what is best for you or your loved one.
